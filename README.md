# Netflix_Project---Power-BI

In this project I analyzed Netflix content using Power BI to understand how titles are distributed across countries, title types, release years, and content ratings.


                                                  📺 Netflix Dashboard Project | Power BI 📊

An interactive Power BI dashboard that explores and visualizes Netflix content based on: 🌍 Country-wise distribution.

🎬 Title Type (Movies & TV Shows)

📅 Release Year (1925–2021)

🔖 Ratings (TV-MA, TV-14, etc.)

This dashboard helps users understand content trends and viewer preferences on Netflix globally.

                                                          📌 Key Insights:

🔴 TV-MA is the most common rating with over 3.2K titles, followed by TV-14 with 2.2K.

🎬 The number of TV Shows and Movies increased sharply from 2015 to 2020, peaking in 2019.

🌎 North America, Europe, and Asia have the highest concentration of Netflix content.

🥇 Top 5 recurring titles include:

Don't Go Breaking My...

                                                          ✅ Recommendations:

📈 Continue producing TV-MA & TV-14 content, as they dominate the platform.

🌐 Expand content availability in underrepresented regions like Africa and parts of Asia.

👪 Add more family/kids content (TV-Y, G, PG), which currently has very low representation.

🔄 Update analysis post-2021 to monitor new trends after the pandemic.
